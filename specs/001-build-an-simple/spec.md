## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to store my photos in a simple application where I can easily upload photos by dragging and dropping them, and view all my photos organized in a single flat structure without complex folder hierarchies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is open, **When** I drag one or more photo files from my computer and drop them onto the upload area, **Then** the photos are uploaded and immediately visible in my photo collection
2. **Given** I have photos in my collection, **When** I view the photo gallery, **Then** all photos are displayed at the same organizational level without folders or categories
3. **Given** I want to upload multiple photos, **When** I select multiple photo files and drag them together, **Then** all selected photos are uploaded simultaneously
4. **Given** I upload a photo, **When** the upload completes, **Then** I receive clear feedback that the upload was successful

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to upload a non-image file?
- How does the system handle very large photo files?
- What happens if my internet connection drops during upload?
- How does the system behave when I try to upload duplicate photos?
