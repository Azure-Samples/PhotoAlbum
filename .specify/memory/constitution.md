# PhotoAlbum Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The PhotoAlbum application MUST prioritize simplicity in design and implementation. Features MUST solve clear user problems without adding unnecessary complexity. Each component MUST serve a single, well-defined purpose. Demo functionality MUST be sufficient to showcase capabilities without over-engineering. The principle of "You Aren't Gonna Need It" (YAGNI) MUST guide all development decisions.

Rationale: For a demo application, complexity creates maintenance burden and obscures the core value proposition. Simple solutions are easier to understand, test, and extend.

### II. Code Quality
All code MUST meet measurable quality standards. Code MUST be readable, maintainable, and properly tested. Functions MUST have single responsibilities with clear inputs and outputs. Dependencies MUST be minimal and justified. Code MUST include appropriate error handling and logging. Technical debt MUST be documented and addressed promptly.

Rationale: High code quality ensures the demo application serves as a positive reference implementation and remains maintainable as requirements evolve.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface MUST provide consistent interaction patterns across all features. Visual design MUST follow established patterns and accessibility guidelines. User feedback MUST be clear and immediate. Navigation MUST be intuitive and predictable. Performance MUST meet user expectations for responsiveness.

Rationale: Consistent UX demonstrates professional development practices and ensures the demo effectively showcases the application's capabilities.

## Quality Standards

All code MUST pass automated quality gates including linting, formatting, and security scanning. Performance MUST meet baseline expectations (page loads <2s, interactions <200ms). Accessibility MUST follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. All user-facing text MUST be clear and professional.

## Development Workflow

Features MUST follow test-driven development (TDD) with tests written before implementation. Code reviews MUST verify compliance with all principles. Changes MUST include appropriate documentation updates. Breaking changes MUST be avoided unless absolutely necessary and properly communicated.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All code reviews and feature decisions MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity MUST be justified against the Simplicity principle. Any principle violations MUST be documented with explicit rationale.

Amendments require updated documentation and migration plan for existing code. Version increments follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for additions, PATCH for clarifications.
