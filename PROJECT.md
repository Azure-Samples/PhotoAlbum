- A modern web browser

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PhotoAlbum
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Apply Database Migrations

The application uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server LocalDB. Migrations are applied automatically on first run, or you can apply them manually:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project PhotoAlbum
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
cd PhotoAlbum
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or `https://localhost:5001` for HTTPS).

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=PhotoAlbumDb;..."
  },
  "PhotoUpload": {
    "MaxFileSizeBytes": 10485760,
    "AllowedMimeTypes": ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif", "image/webp"],
    "UploadPath": "wwwroot/uploads"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **MaxFileSizeBytes**: Maximum file size in bytes (default: 10MB)
- **AllowedMimeTypes**: Array of accepted MIME types
- **UploadPath**: Directory for storing uploaded files (relative to project root)

## Running Tests

The project includes both unit tests and integration tests.

### Run All Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

### Run Unit Tests Only

```bash
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
```

### Run Integration Tests Only

```bash
dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
```

## Development

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 9.0 (Razor Pages)
- **Database**: SQL Server LocalDB with Entity Framework Core 9.0
- **Testing**: xUnit with WebApplicationFactory
- **Image Processing**: SixLabors.ImageSharp 3.1.11
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3.0, Vanilla JavaScript

### Architecture

The application uses a clean architecture with separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: Razor Pages (Index, Detail) and JavaScript
- **Service Layer**: PhotoService for business logic
- **Data Layer**: Entity Framework Core with PhotoAlbumContext
- **Storage Abstraction**: Indirect image serving via `/photo/{id}` endpoint
  - Frontend uses photo IDs, not file paths
  - Enables future migration to cloud storage (Azure Blob, AWS S3, etc.)
  - No frontend changes needed when changing storage backend

See [FEATURE_INDIRECT_IMAGE_SERVING.md](FEATURE_INDIRECT_IMAGE_SERVING.md) for details on the image serving architecture.

### Code Quality

The project follows standard C# coding conventions and includes:

- XML documentation on all public APIs
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Integration tests for page handlers
- Consistent formatting (enforced via `dotnet format`)

### Building for Release

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

### Publishing

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

## Usage

1. **Upload Photos**:
   - Drag and drop one or more photos onto the upload zone
   - Or click "Browse" to select files from your computer
   - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (max 10MB each)

2. **View Gallery**:
   - Uploaded photos appear in a responsive grid
   - Each card shows the photo thumbnail, filename, dimensions, file size, and upload date
   - Click on any photo thumbnail or filename to view it full-size

3. **View Photo Details**:
   - Click any photo to open the detail view
   - See full-size image with comprehensive metadata
   - Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate between photos
   - Click "Back to Gallery" to return to the main page

4. **Delete Photos**:
   - Click the "Delete" button on the detail page to remove a photo
   - Confirmation dialog will appear before deletion
   - Photo is removed from both the database and file system## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection errors:

1. Verify SQL Server LocalDB is installed:
   ```bash
   sqllocaldb info
   ```

2. Create a new LocalDB instance if needed:
   ```bash
   sqllocaldb create MSSQLLocalDB
   sqllocaldb start MSSQLLocalDB
   ```

3. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` if using a different instance.

### Upload Directory Permissions

Ensure the application has write permissions to the upload directory (`wwwroot/uploads`). The directory is created automatically on first upload if it doesn't exist.
