# PhotoAlbum - Azure Migration Demo for GitHub Copilot

A comprehensive demonstration project showcasing how to use **GitHub Copilot app modernization for .NET** to get your
app prepared for Azure deployment.

## Project Overview

PhotoAlbum is an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application designed to manage and display photo galleries. The application allows users to upload photos, store them locally, and view them in a responsive gallery interface with detailed metadata.

PhotoAlbum provides a simple photo management system, allowing users to:
- Upload photos via drag-and-drop or file selection
- View uploaded photos in a responsive gallery grid
- View full-size photos with detailed metadata (dimensions, file size, aspect ratio)
- Navigate between photos using Previous/Next controls
- Delete photos from the gallery
- Store photo metadata in SQL Server LocalDB

## 📋 Prerequisites

    - ASP.NET and web development
    - .NET desktop development
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** for version control
- **GitHub account** with Copilot access

## ⚙️ VS Configuration

1. Set the environment variable `COPILOT_INTERNALUSER=true` in your system to enable the GitHub Copilot internal use features.
1. Set the following GitHub Copilot setting in "Tools" menu --> "Options...". Search the setting from the top left search box, and update the value accordingly.

## 🔄 Demonstration: Migrating to Azure Blob Storage

### Step 1: Run Assessment

1. In Visual Studio, open **GitHub Copilot Chat**
2. Type:
	```
	@Modernize Migrate to Azure
	```
3. The extension will analyze your code and identify modernization opportunities
4. Review the assessment report showing local file system usage

### Step 2: Start Migration

1. In the assessment report, click **Run Task** button for the issue of **File System Management**:

   ![Run Task](media/run-migartion-task.png)

2. The extension will:
   - Create a migration plan in `.appmod/.migration/plan.md`
   - Set up progress tracking in `.appmod/.migration/progress.md`

3. After the plan is created, the agent will stop to ask you to review the plan. Type "Continue" to proceed with the migration.

4. During migration, the agent will call various tools and commands to execute version control and code modification, please "Allow" when the tool calls are asked.

4. After the code is migrated, the agent will build and validate this project, and fix if any errors are detected.

Some tips during the migration:

- After updating project related settings, it will reload the project. This is likely to bring the "Solution Explorer" view to the top, and you need to click the "GitHub Copilot Chat" view tab to bring it back and check the latest conversations.
- If the session stop in the middle of the whole process. Try sending "Continue" in the chat box to resume.
### Step 3: Review Migration Results

The extension provides comprehensive tracking:
- ✅ **Detailed progress tracking** with checkboxes for each task
- 🔄 **Git commits** for each major step with descriptive messages
- 🏗️ **Build verification** to ensure compilation succeeds
- 🔒 **Security validation** to check for vulnerabilities
